Evidence II Daniel Ruiz Aldaco
During my participation in this course I learned about fundamental topics that have proven to be of great importance in solving complex problems in the business realm and beyond. Specifically, three prominent topics were linear programming, forecasts for decision making, and basic queuing theory. Linear programming is a powerful tool that allows for optimizing the allocation of limited resources to achieve the best possible outcomes. I learned how to formulate problems in terms of linear constraints and maximization or minimization objectives, providing me with the ability to find optimal solutions for challenges such as production planning, staffing allocation, and inventory management. I really enjoy this class.
